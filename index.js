 * ### Challenge `processFirstItem`
 * 
 * @instructions
 * Implement a higher-order function called `processFirstItem`.
 * It takes two arguments:
 * @param stringList an array of strings.
 * @param callback function that takes a string as its argument.
 * @returns the result of invoking `callback` with the FIRST element in `stringList`.
 * 
 * Example of usage of this higher-order function:
 * Invoking `processFirstItem` passing `['foo', 'bar']` and `(str) => str + str`,
 * should return 'foofoo'.

/* Task 1: `counterMaker`
 * Study the code for counter1 and counter2. Answer the questions below.
 * 
 * 1. What is the difference between counter1 and counter2?
 * Answer:
 * counter1 uses the private variable `count` to keep track of the score, while
  counter2 uses a variable `count` described outside the function.

 * 2. Which of the two uses a closure? How can you tell?
 * Answer:
 * counter1 makes use of closer through the child function `counter()`
  using the variable `count` from the parent function. While counter2
  does something similar, function counter2 is a parent, not a child,
  and the variable `count` is a global variable. 

 * 3. In what scenario would the counter1 code be preferable? In what scenario would counter2 be better? 
 *  Answer:
 * counter1/counterMaker is better when you need to track several
    independent counters. The problem with this approach is that you
    cannot access the count without incrementing the counter. counter2
    addresses this issue, since count is defined as a global
    variable. However, a new count variable and a new function must be
    defined for every score you need to keep track of.

/* Task 2: inning() 

Write a function called `inning` that returns a random number of points that a team scored in an inning. This should be a whole number between 0 and 2. */

/* Task 3: finalScore()

Write a higher order function called `finalScore` that accepts the callback function `inning` (from above) and a number of innings and and returns the final score of the game in the form of an object.

For example, 

finalScore(inning, 9) might return: 
{
  "Home": 11,
  "Away": 5,
}

/* Task 4: 

Create a function called `scoreboard` that accepts the following parameters: 

(1) Callback function `getInningScore`
(2) Callback function `inning`
(3) A number of innings

and returns the score at each pont in the game, like so:
1st inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
2nd inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
3rd inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
4th inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
5th inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
6th inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
7th inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
8th inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
9th inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
Final Score: awayTeam - homeTeam */
